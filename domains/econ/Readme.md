# Economic Modeling

When we add the action knobs to our tool, we will need to estimate the impact that both individual actions (e,g. biking 10km to work) and collective actions (e.g. going carbon free) will have (e.g. on average CO2 concentrations). We also have to choose the actions that people can/will make depending on where they live. It was also discussed that we can factor in the price of groceries or fuel in 80 years, to show people the consequences that they can expect on their budget and spending habits.

To do:

- Find or design economic models which can convert action knobs (e.g. carbon tax price, or renewable energy portfolio target proportion) into climate variables (like CO2 equivalent concentration).
