# User Research ðŸ“‡

We need to identify our **target users**, their needs/expectations, and better define our value proposition. We need to understand **how our users understand science** and how much of it they expect. We want to find the sweet spot between **scientific credibility and user-friendliness**.

Alongside the behavioral research, we need to test as soon as possible how people **perceive and interpret** our approach and goals. We also need to evaluate if the current hypothesis (image of oneâ€™s home) is going to make them change their mind or their behavior regarding climate change. With the help of a UI designer, we should put out wireframe (drawings of what the website could look like) to do the testing as soon as we have identified our users.
