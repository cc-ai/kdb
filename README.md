## How to use üìÉ

This repository is the VICC project's knowledge database. We use it to:

* Store [resources](/resources) (code, tools, news articles and so on)
* Distribute tasks according to specific [domains](/domains)
* Manage the project ([workflow](/workflow))

## Contributing ü§ù

### Goal ü•Ö

We cannot stress enough how **collaborative** and **open** this project should be. This means that you may (and should) bring to the discussion anything you believe can be improved, suggest modifications to the workflow and **share** resources.

At first, it may seem pointless to just store a link as a line in this repository. But in the long run it will help the community a lot as nothing will be lost and it will be easy to refer new-comers to existing knowledge.

### Issues üí• 

We use this repository's [issues](https://github.com/cc-ai/kdb/issues) to discuss **everything**. Have a look at the [workflow](/workflow) to better understand how we use them.

Keep in mind that both domain-specific issues (like questions/discussions about a GAN model or about a website feature) and meta issues (about how we manage this project, broken links, typos etc.) are relevant.

### Getting started ‚ö°Ô∏è

#### New to Github? ü¶é

We have compiled a short list of basic things for you to know in order to make the most out of Github without needing to become a software engineer first -> [**Github at `cc-ai`**](/workflow/gettingstarted.md)

#### Experienced contributor ü¶ñ 

The [workflow's `Readme`](/workflow) contains everything you need to know. Go through it at least once to get a feeling of how we want to work before you do your usual magic. Again, if you find some useless friction, open a `domain:meta` issue to discuss it.

According to your background and skills, you will find the list of everything we need help with in [domains/](/domains) along with relevant issues.

#### In any case

Add yourself to our [Who's Who?](workflow/whoswho.md) if you plan on contributing !

## About üí°

In case you stumbled upon this repository inadvertently, here is our story.

The VICC project is an interdisciplinary project aimed at creating images of accurate, vivid, and personalized outcomes of climate change. Our goal is to use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to produce images of how neighborhoods and houses will look like following the effects of global warming. By creating a more visceral understanding of the effects of climate change, we aim to strengthen public support for necessary actions and motivate people to make impactful decisions. As a prototype, we first focus on modeling flood consequences on homes.
