## How to use 📃

This repository is the CCAI project's knowledge database. We use it to:

* Store [resources](/resources) (code, tools, news articles and so on)
* Distribute tasks according to specific [domains](/domains)
* Manage the project ([workflow](/workflow))

## Contributing 🤝

### About💡

We cannot stress enough how **collaborative** and **open** this project should be. This means that you may (and should) bring to the discussion anything you believe can be improved, suggest modifications to the workflow and **share** resources.

At first, it may seem pointless to just store a link as a line in this repository. But in the long run it will help the community a lot as nothing will be lost and it will be easy to refer new-comers to existing knowledge.

### Issues 💥 

We use this repository's [issues](https://github.com/cc-ai/kdb/issues) to discuss **everything**. Have a look at the [workflow](/workflow) to better understand how we use them.

Keep in mind that both domain-specific issues (like questions/discussions about a GAN model or about a website feature) and meta issues (about how we manage this project, broken links, typos etc.) are relevant.

### Getting started ⚡️

#### New to Github? 🦎

We have compiled a shor list of basic things for you to know in order to make the most out of Github without needing to become a software engineer first -> [**Github at `cc-ai`**](/workflow/gettingstarted.md)

#### Experienced contributor 🦖 

The [workflow's `Readme`](/workflow) contains everything you need to know. Go through it at least once to get a feeling of how we want to work before you do your usual magic. Again, if you find some useless friction, open a `domain:meta` issue to discuss it.

According to your background and skills, you will find the list of everything we need help with in [domains/](/domains) along with relevant issues
