# Workflow

## Github

(New with Github ? -> [How to get started w/ Github, cc-ai style](/workflow/gettingstarted.md))

Code repositories depend on the `cc-ai` *organization*.

The [CCAI - Workflow](https://github.com/orgs/cc-ai/projects/1) *project* (**CWP** hereafter) tracks to-dos, issues suggestions and so on from these repositoires:

* [kdb](https://github.com/cc-ai/kdb) -> this is the main shared repo, the CC-AI Knowledge Base
* [floods-frontend](https://github.com/cc-ai/floods-frontend)
* [floods-backend](https://github.com/cc-ai/floods-backend)
* [floods](https://github.com/cc-ai/floods)

Use CWP as much as you can to better communicate and sync with the rest of the team.

For now it is a centralized project ; if one or more other repositories grows we'll simply create another one there. CWP is for the whole CC-AI team, not dealing with particular issues for a project. We'll learn as we go, if you want to modify this workflow, do open an issue in [kdb](https://github.com/cc-ai/kdb)
