# Workflow üåä

## How we use Github üìÇ

(New to Github ? -> [How to get started w/ Github, cc-ai style](/workflow/gettingstarted.md))

Code repositories depend on the `cc-ai` *organization*, managed by @vict0rsch and @sashavor.

There are 2 teams (mainly):

- The Core Team is composed of people at Mila working at least 50% of their time on this project
- The Contributors Team is composed of people affiliated to other organizations and/or volunteering to spend some time on this project

The organization currently has these repositories:

* [kdb](https://github.com/cc-ai/kdb) -> this is the main shared repo, the CC-AI Knowledge Base
* [floods-frontend](https://github.com/cc-ai/floods-frontend) (self-explanatory)
* [floods-backend](https://github.com/cc-ai/floods-backend) (self-explanatory)
* [floods-gans](https://github.com/cc-ai/floods-gans) -> where we experiment with generative models to simulate floods

If you'd rather have your own cc-ai repository for the task you work on, feel free to open a ![][domain:meta] issue

### Good practices üëç

#### Git üåµ

Read through [these commit guidelines](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide) (~10 min) as they will help us work together better. A little more advanced content can be found [here - it walks you though the differences between merging and rebasing branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

Also if you like Github from the command line, checkout Github's own tool: [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub)

### Issues and Labels üí•

Some guidelines to understand our **issues and labels**

* Use `kdb`'s [issues](https://github.com/cc-ai/kdb/issues) for general purpose issues the community should be aware or any kind of question you have

  * If you work on a specific repository ([floods-gans](https://github.com/cc-ai/floods-gans) for instance) use its issues for everyday tasks, but [`kdb`'s](https://github.com/cc-ai/kdb/issues) for general concerns

* Assign people to issues (maybe yourself)
* Use Labels!
  
  * Use the ![][work in progress] label to acknowledge the issue and state you've started working on it
  * Use the **priority** tags (![][priority:high] or ![][priority:low])
  * Label as ![][domain:meta] issues relating to the overall CC-AI project and its management
  * Use the ![][keep in mind] label to signal thoughts you've had which may someday be relevant
  * Even if you're not *assigned* to an issue, if it bears the ![][good first issue] tag you probably can still do something
  * The ![][priority:critical] label should never be used. Except for extraordinary issues.
  * Use `domain:` labels for people to be able to quickly pick up what's relevant to them. See [domains](/domains)
* **Close** issues when resolved. They may be re-openned later on. You may also **lock** a conversation if the decision is final.
* **Suggest improvements** to these guidelines and practices

### Reusing `kdb`'s labels in other repositories üè∑

This procedure describes how to import `kdb`'s labels into your repositories / other cc-ai repositories.

**This will overwrite your labels** so if you want your own labels you can do this once and then delete `settings.yml` otherwise it will delete your repo-specific labels when pushed later on.

Add a `.github` folder and a `.github/settings.yml` at the repo's root. 

**If** [labels.yml](labels.yml) is up to date, copy its content into your `.github/settings.yml`. 

**Otherwise** run [**this script**](https://gist.github.com/Vict0rSch/188a60f1e87a68844e41082583df64c4) in your browser console on page https://github.com/cc-ai/kdb/labels and add the created file to `.github/`. 

It works like this:

1. Get `labels` as a list of objects with fields `name` `color` and `description`
2. Create a `yml`-compatible string `out`
3. Download `out` as a `settings.yml` file
